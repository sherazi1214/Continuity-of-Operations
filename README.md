Governance refers to the policies, responsibilities, and authority structure that ensure continuity planning is created, updated, and enforced.

**Urdu:**
Governance ka matlab hai ke COOP k liye clear roles, policies aur responsibilities assign ki jayein taa k plan sirf document na rahe, balki properly implement ho.

#### Includes:

Senior management involvement

Compliance with regulations (ISO 22301, NIST SP 800-34)

Assigning COOP managers & coordinators

### Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)

**English:**
A Disaster Recovery Plan is a technical plan that focuses on restoring IT systems, data, and infrastructure after a disaster.

**Urdu:**
DRP ka matlab hai ke agar servers, network ya data destroy ho jayein to unko backup se restore karne ka plan.

Focus: IT systems, Data backup, Replication, Alternate sites

### Continuity of Operation Workflow

Typical Steps:

## Risk Assessment

Identify threats (cyber, natural, technical).

**Urdu:** Risk ka pata lagana.

Business Impact Analysis (BIA)

Identify which functions are critical.

**Urdu:** Kaunsa kaam sabse zyada important hai ye identify karna.

### Strategy Development

Define backup, alternate sites, redundancy.

### Plan Development

Write detailed COOP/BCP/DRP.

### Implementation

Deploy backups, replication, cloud, alternate sites.

Testing & Training

Regular drills, exercises.

Maintenance & Audit

Update plans regularly.

### Testing Objectives (Why test COOP/BCP/DRP?)

**English:**
Testing ensures the continuity plan works in real scenarios.

 **Urdu:**
Testing ka purpose hai dekhna k plan kaam karta bhi hai ya sirf paper pe likha hai.

### Objectives:

Validate recovery time (RTO)

Validate data loss tolerance (RPO)

Identify weaknesses

Train employees

Ensure compliance

### Parallel Processing

**English:**
Parallel Processing means running critical business operations simultaneously at a backup site while the primary site is still operational.

**Urdu:**
Parallel processing ka matlab hai ek hi time pe primary site aur backup site dono par kaam chalna. Agar main site crash ho jaye to backup instantly continue karega.

### Plan Audit

**English:**
A continuity plan audit is a formal review to ensure that COOP, DRP, and BCP are effective, up-to-date, and compliant with standards.

**Urdu:**
Plan audit ka matlab hai check karna k plan latest hai, realistic hai aur compliance follow karta hai ya nahi.

### Audit Focus:

Documentation accuracy

Employee awareness

Backup testing results

Compliance with ISO/NIST standards

Recovery Time Objective (RTO) & Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
